## The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer Analysis Project

The objective of this project is to utilize regression techniques to predict a continuous value using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan-Cancer analysis project. 

### Aim anf goals 
The goal of this project is to train regression models using this data to predict a continuous value representing a specific molecular characteristic of cancers. The aims are the following:
- Study the genomes of various cancers to better understand their molecular characteristics.
- Assist in developing new treatment strategies


### Dataset
The data, collected from different types of tumors, is stored in a CSV file named data.csv.
- Data CSV
- Labels CSV
